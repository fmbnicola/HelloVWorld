## Learn programming concepts in VR

Programming is becoming more and more of a necessary skill for all kinds of careers, as such, the age of contact with these concepts is trending down and a greater percentage of people are expected to learn how to code. This leads to a greater necessity for an effective introduction that will keep the users engaged and interested in learning more. Although some efforts to create interactive experiences that teach this skill have been made, very few try to use gamification or even leverage the benefits of emergent technology, such as Virtual Reality, to prevent the feelings of disinterest and demotivation often felt by beginners with such complex topics. To mitigate these issues we present Hello VWorld, a VR puzzle game, designed to be the first contact with programming concepts for total beginners. VR allows us to create an environment with great potential for learning, being able to keep the user immersed and focused all the while providing great accessibility through it's natural and familiar motion controls. The goal of Hello VWorld is to teach the fundamental thought processes required and motivate further learning ultimately providing a smooth introduction to this area of knowledge.
